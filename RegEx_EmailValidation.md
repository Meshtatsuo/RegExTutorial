# Regular Expressions and Email Validation

In this write up I will explore how we can use regular expressions to validate emails for use in form validation.

## Summary

> /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

In this write up I will explore how to read this regular expression, how to identify different components that make up the regex, and how we can use this for validating email inputs.
